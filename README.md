# About Me
##### A software engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience in Agile development and a passion for technology. My undergraduate program allowed me to gain valuable experience through several internships with different companies, which provided me with a wide array of challenges to strengthen my software engineering skills. I recently relocated to the PNW, and I am seeking a full-time remote position in the Software Engineering, Quality Assurance, and/or Data Analytics field.
